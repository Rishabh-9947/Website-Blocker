# Website-Blocker
This project involves creating a Python script that can block access to specified websites. This is typically used for productivity by preventing access to distracting websites during work hours, or for parental control purposes.
# Website Blocker

The "Website Blocker" is a Python script designed to help improve productivity by blocking access to distracting websites or to enforce parental controls. It works by modifying the system's hosts file to redirect specified websites to the localhost address, effectively preventing them from loading.

## Features

- Block access to specified websites by redirecting them to localhost.
- Easily add or remove websites from the block list.
- Option to block and unblock websites manually.
- Can be scheduled to block websites during specific times (with additional scripting or task scheduling).

## Prerequisites

This script requires administrative privileges to modify the system's hosts file. Ensure you have Python installed on your system to run the script.

## Usage

To use the script, follow these steps:

1. Run the script with administrative privileges.
2. When prompted, choose whether to block or unblock websites.
3. The script will modify the hosts file based on your choice.

```bash
python website_blocker.py

Customization
Edit the blocked_websites list within the script to add or remove websites you wish to block or unblock:
python
blocked_websites = [
    "www.example.com",
    "example.com",
    # Add more websites as needed
]

Scheduling (Optional)
To automatically block websites during certain hours, you can schedule the script to run using your operating system's task scheduler (e.g., Task Scheduler on Windows, cron jobs on Unix-based systems).
Contributing
If you have ideas for enhancements or additional features, such as a user-friendly interface or real-time blocking without modifying the hosts file, contributions are welcome. Please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
